# üè† Shap Values with California Housing Dataset
This project was developed to put in practice Shap Values in the regression models.
This project is divided into:
1. Exploratory analysis of a [Sklearn Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)
2. In order to have a comparison, it was developed using 3 different approaches:
- Linear Regression
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
3. Shap Values 
PS: In my case, it took me around **35 minutes** to run the Shap Values.
